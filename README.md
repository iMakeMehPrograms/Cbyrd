# CBYRD
A "game engine" that's just a framework for you to hang off of. Cbyrd is also Macintosh-only currently. Cmake multi-platform build support is on the way.

# CHANGELOG 
## VERSION 000.A.22
- Base features implemented. Nothing much.

# THE FUTURE
- Thinking of putting SDL support in.
- Maybe add functions for extra thread support? (users may want to do more math/async operations?)
- Cmake for multi-platform build support?
