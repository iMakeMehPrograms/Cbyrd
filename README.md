# CBYRD
A "game engine" that's just a framework for you to hang off of. Cbyrd is also Macintosh-only currently. Cmake multi-platform build support is on the way.

# CHANGELOG 

## VERSION 000.C.22
- Forgot to delete files, whoops.

## VERSION 000.B.22
- More things added to the "future" section. 

## VERSION 000.A.22
- Base features implemented.

# THE FUTURE
- Thinking of putting SDL support in.
- Maybe add functions for extra thread support? (users may want to do more math/async operations?)
- Cmake for multi-platform build support?
- Actual documentation.
- Far far future: OpenGL 3D graphics support?
- Closer but still far future: SYCL GPU processing support?
